//// 1. What is Encapsulation? Try to list out the benefits of Encapsulation.
Encapsulation is an object-oriented programming practice where we wrap the data members (properties) and member functions (methods) inside a class.
The benefits of encapsulation includes:
- information hiding => We can hide the internal values / types of data members and implementation of a class.
- access control => We can specify how an object can be accessed by its clients. For example, only get() is allowed but set() is not provided.
- data validation => We can implement data validation in the set() function to make sure that the format or value of the user input is valid.





//// 2. Try to explain what is enum and why we use them.
